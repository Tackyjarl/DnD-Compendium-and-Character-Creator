# Dungeons and Dragons Compendium and Character Creator

This frontend-only application utilizes the Dungeons and Dragons(DnD) Fifth Edition Standard Resource Documents(SRD) to provide a simple index of all the things needed to make a DnD character. The first page contains the compendium with all the information from the SRD. The second page contains a form when you can enter the desired information to be printed onto an official DnD character sheet PDF.

## Tools

This application is built using React

This application takes use of the DnD 5e SRD API (https://5e-bits.github.io/docs/) to access all of the information of the SRD to be displayed on in the compendium.

The ability to translate the form data into PDF format is taken care of by using PDF-LIB (https://pdf-lib.js.org/)
